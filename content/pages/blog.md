  This section contains case studies of community programs primarily from across
  North America. It includes a broad sampling of programs to offer a wide
  variety of approaches and tools used, locations, types of organizations and
  participants, activities being promoted and problems being addressed. Most of
  these case studies illustrate approaches that have worked. However, examples
  of potential pitfalls are also included to provide you with a realistic map of
  the terrain ahead.


  We are actively looking for new case studies with measured impact results. Do you know of any that might make good additions to this site? [Please let us know](https://toolsofchange.com/en/contact-us/).


  All the Case Studies and examples are described in the past tense, including programs that are still operating. If the program is still operating, the Case Study summary is written in the present tense.
